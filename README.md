# Rebooting the Web of Trust IX: Prague (September 2019)

This repository contains documents related to RWOT8, the eighth
Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop, which ran in Barcelona,
Spain on September 3rd to 6th, 2019. The goal of the workshop is to
generate five technical white papers and/or proposals on topics
decided by the group that would have the greatest impact on the
future.

## Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a
one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on
either:

   * A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
   * A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

## Primers

These primers overview major topics which are likely to be discussed at the design workshop. If you read nothing else, read these. (But really, read as much as you can!)
