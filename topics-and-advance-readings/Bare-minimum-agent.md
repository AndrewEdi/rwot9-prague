# Bare minimum agent for identity

## Abstract
Create a short abstract of background, problem and possible solutions

## Background
Working with devices in the African continent, we time after time experience device problems with the current solutions we work with. Also we experience that the device penetration today is not 100%, meanin that it is difficult to provide value for them in an open eco system.

We want to discuss what the bare minimum of specifications that an identity app needs to provide value, and how can this identity be represented physically? What are the pros and cons of that.

The second issue is how to enable the ecosystem, what is needed to get other startups with their own solutions in play. SDKs, libraries, proxys, shared infrastructure? That is questions I would love to raise and discuss to create a documented information letter for anyone wanting to charge into this space.
