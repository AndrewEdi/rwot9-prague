# Bare minimum agent for identity

## Abstract
Create a short abstract of background, problem and possible solutions

## Background
Working with devices in the African continent, we time after time experience device problems with the current existing identity solutions we work with. Also we experience that the current device penetration today, in Uganda, is not 100%, meaning that it is difficult to provide value for everybody.

We want to discuss what the bare minimum specifications that an identity app needs, to provide value, and how can an identity be represented physically? What are the pros and cons of of a combination identity.

The second issue is to discuss how to enable an ecosystem, what is needed to get other startups with their own non did solutions in play. Is it SDKs, libraries, proxys, some kind of shared infrastructure? That is questions I would love to raise and discuss to create an information letter, from a collection of experts, for anyone wanting to charge into this space.

## Slow devices
Phones are getting faster. I don’t think anyone will disagree with that. Stronger GPUs, faster and more CPUs, more RAM. Phones are going through the same rapid development desktop machines did in the early 2000s.

However, that’s just one edge of the distribution. **_Slow_  phones are stuck in 2014.** The process to create the chips from half a decade ago has gotten so cheap that phones can now be sold for around $20, and cheaper phone will reach a wider audience. ~50% of the world are online, meaning that the other ~50% are not. However, these offliners are _coming_ online and are predominantly located in emerging markets such as many of the African countries, where people simply can’t afford any of the [Wealthy Western Web](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/world-wide-web-not-wealthy-western-web-part-1/) flagship phones.

We want to discuss how to tackle this properly and how to enable them to represent themselves online with a proper ID and DID.

## No devices
As mentioned above, there are still a lot of people who are offline, and they are slowly getting online. But to save them some time, when getting online, from having to understand what this identity thing is and get a feel of how to properly represent yourself online.  We want to understand what can be done for the no devicers/offliners.

Last year, ID pass presented a really cool solution and I want to continue that talk. ID pass solution can work well and is perfect for closed ecosystems like a refugee camp, but will have a problem of working well in an open ecosystem like the city of Kampala.

This area needs to be discussed, in terms of what are the needs for such a physical identity. What libs need to be made to enable eas
