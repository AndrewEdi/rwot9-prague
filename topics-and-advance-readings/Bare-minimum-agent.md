# Bare minimum agent for identity

## Abstract
Diwala want to contribute to enable the current ["offliners"](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/world-wide-web-not-wealthy-western-web-part-1/)  to take back control of their digital selves. This paper goes through some problem areas of the current emerging markets and their ability to run the existing decentralize identity solutions, based on their device penetration. 

We want to come out of RWoT with a clear information letter, from a collection of experts, how to get started to deliver a bare minimum decentralized identity solution.

## Background
Working with devices in the African continent, we time after time experience device problems with the current existing identity solutions we work with. Also we experience that the current device penetration today, in Uganda particularly, is not 100%, meaning that it is difficult to provide value for everybody.

We want to discuss what the bare minimum specifications that an identity app needs to provide value? How can an identity be represented physically? What are the pros and cons of a combination identity.

The second issue is to discuss how to enable an ecosystem, what is needed to get other startups with their own non did solutions in play. Is it SDKs, libraries, proxys, some kind of shared infrastructure? That is questions I would love to raise and discuss to create an information letter, from a collection of experts, for anyone wanting to charge into this space.

## Slow devices
Phones are getting faster. I don’t think anyone will disagree with that. Stronger GPUs, faster and more CPUs, more RAM. Phones are going through the same rapid development desktop machines did in the early 2000s.

However, that’s just one edge of the distribution. **_Slow_  phones are stuck in 2014.** The process to create the chips from half a decade ago has gotten so cheap that phones can now be sold for around $20, and cheaper phone will reach a wider audience. ~50% of the world are online, meaning that the other ~50% are not. However, these offliners are _coming_ online and are predominantly located in emerging markets such as many of the African countries, where people simply can’t afford any of the [Wealthy Western Web](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/world-wide-web-not-wealthy-western-web-part-1/) flagship phones.

We want to discuss how to tackle this properly and how to enable them to represent themselves online with a proper ID and DID.

## No devices
As mentioned above, there are still a lot of people who are offline, and they are slowly getting online. But to save them some time, when getting online, from having to understand what this identity thing is and get a feel of how to properly represent yourself online.  We want to understand what can be done for the no devicers/offliners.

Last year, ID pass presented a really cool solution and I want to continue that talk. ID pass solution can work well and is perfect for closed ecosystems like a refugee camp, but will have a problem of working well in an open ecosystem like the city of Kampala.

This area needs to be discussed, in terms of what are the needs for such a physical identity. What libs need to be created to enable easy device to card communication. What are the best way for an interaction to happen, recieving a VC, backing up a VC and so on.

## What is bare minimum specifications
Mentioning the two main issues of bringing decentralized identity into a market with quite a lot of offliners it would be very interessting to spur up the discussion on what is the bare minimum to be able to represent an identity. Are we even able to put together a representation of an application, or an architecture map that will increase the speed of development for beginners

# Goal
With this paper I want to create the dicsussions on how to approach a market with a clear split of device possession and not, and what types of devices that are in the market. Can we come together and define something bare minimum for an decentralized identity solution, that will enable these people to take back control of their digital selves.
