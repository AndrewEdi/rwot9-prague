# Bare minimum agent for identity

## Abstract
Working with devices in the African continent, we time after time experience device problems with the current solutions we work with. Also we experience that the device penetration today is not 100%, meanin that it is difficult to provide value for them in an open eco system.

We want to discuss what the bare minimum of specifications that an identity app needs to provide value, and how can this identity be represented physically? What are the pros and cons of that.
