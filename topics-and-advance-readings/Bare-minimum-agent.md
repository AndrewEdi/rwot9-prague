# Bare minimum agent for identity

## Abstract
Create a short abstract of background, problem and possible solutions

## Background
Working with devices in the African continent, we time after time experience device problems with the current existing identity solutions we work with. Also we experience that the current device penetration today, in Uganda, is not 100%, meaning that it is difficult to provide value for everybody.

We want to discuss what the bare minimum specifications that an identity app needs, to provide value, and how can an identity be represented physically? What are the pros and cons of of a combination identity.

The second issue is to discuss how to enable an ecosystem, what is needed to get other startups with their own non did solutions in play. Is it SDKs, libraries, proxys, some kind of shared infrastructure? That is questions I would love to raise and discuss to create an information letter, from a collection of experts, for anyone wanting to charge into this space.
